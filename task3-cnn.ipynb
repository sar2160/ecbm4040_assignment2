    "[https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural networks which is highly effective for image processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember when we build an MLP model, each input is multiplied by its own weights. When the input dimension or the first layer is too large, we will need a giant matrix to store our weights. This could easily become a problem in image processing since the dimension of a vectorized image could easily exceed 1000 (consider CIFAR-10 which has images of shape 32Ã—32=1024, yet the resolution is so low). \n",
    "\n",
    "In CNN, the weights can be shared: the same filter (also known as 'weights' or 'kernel') moves over the input, and at each position an output value is calculated. This means the same weights are used by the entire input, therefore saving a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Illustration of the CNN](./ecbm4040/notebook_images/task3_1.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "__Convolution:__  In the picture above, the input is a 7-by-7 image, and the filter is shown as a blue 3-by-3 grid. The filter overlaps with the top-left corner of the input, and we perform an element-wise multiplication followed by a summation, then put the sum into the output matrix. The filter then moves several pixels right, covering a new input area so a new sum can be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Training:__ One thing to remember is that there would be a lot of filters for each layer in a CNN, and the goal of training is to find the best filters for your task. Each filter tries to capture one specific feature. Typically, in the first convolutional layer which directly looks at your input, the filters try to capture information about color and edges which we know as local features; in higher layers, due to the effect of max-pooling, the receptive-fields of filters becomes large so more global and complex features can be detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Architecture:__ For classification tasks, a CNN usually starts with convolution followed by max-pooling. After that, the feature maps will be flattened so that we could append fully connected layers. Common activation functions include ReLu, ELU in the convolution layers, and softmax in the fully connected layers (to calculate the classification scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Convolution__: element-wise multiplication followed by summation of your input and one of your filters in the CNN context.\n",
    "* __Filter/kernel/weights__: a grid or a set of grids typically smaller than your input size that moves over the input space to generate output. Each filter captures one type of feature.\n",
    "* __Feature/feature maps__: the output of a hidden layer. Think of it as another representation of your data. \n",
    "* __Pooling__: an downsampling operation that joins local information together, so the higher layers' receptive fields can be bigger. The most seen pooling operation is max-pooling, which outputs the maximum of all values inside the pool.\n",
    "* __Flatten__: a junction between convolution layers and fully connected layers. Used to turn 2-D feature maps into 1-D. For tasks such as image segmentation where the output also needs to be 2-D, this won't be used.\n",
    "* __Border mode__: usually refers to 'VALID' or 'SAME'. Under 'VALID' mode, only when the filter and the input fully overlap can a convolution be conducted; under 'SAME' mode, the output size is the same as the input size, and when the filter and the input don't fully overlap (happens at the edge/corner of input) we pad zeroes (or other designated numbers) and then do convolution."
