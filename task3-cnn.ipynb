    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural networks which is highly effective for image processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember when we build an MLP model, each input is multiplied by its own weights. When the input dimension or the first layer is too large, we will need a giant matrix to store our weights. This could easily become a problem in image processing since the dimension of a vectorized image could easily exceed 1000 (consider CIFAR-10 which has images of shape 32Ã—32=1024, yet the resolution is so low). \n",
    "\n",
    "In CNN, the weights can be shared: the same filter (also known as 'weights' or 'kernel') moves over the input, and at each position an output value is calculated. This means the same weights are used by the entire input, therefore saving a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "__Convolution:__  In the picture above, the input is a 7-by-7 image, and the filter is shown as a blue 3-by-3 grid. The filter overlaps with the top-left corner of the input, and we perform an element-wise multiplication followed by a summation, then put the sum into the output matrix. The filter then moves several pixels right, covering a new input area so a new sum can be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Training:__ One thing to remember is that there would be a lot of filters for each layer in a CNN, and the goal of training is to find the best filters for your task. Each filter tries to capture one specific feature. Typically, in the first convolutional layer which directly looks at your input, the filters try to capture information about color and edges which we know as local features; in higher layers, due to the effect of max-pooling, the receptive-fields of filters becomes large so more global and complex features can be detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Architecture:__ For classification tasks, a CNN usually starts with convolution followed by max-pooling. After that, the feature maps will be flattened so that we could append fully connected layers. Common activation functions include ReLu, ELU in the convolution layers, and softmax in the fully connected layers (to calculate the classification scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Convolution__: element-wise multiplication followed by summation of your input and one of your filters in the CNN context.\n",
    "* __Filter/kernel/weights__: a grid or a set of grids typically smaller than your input size that moves over the input space to generate output. Each filter captures one type of feature.\n",
    "* __Feature/feature maps__: the output of a hidden layer. Think of it as another representation of your data. \n",
    "* __Pooling__: an downsampling operation that joins local information together, so the higher layers' receptive fields can be bigger. The most seen pooling operation is max-pooling, which outputs the maximum of all values inside the pool.\n",
    "* __Flatten__: a junction between convolution layers and fully connected layers. Used to turn 2-D feature maps into 1-D. For tasks such as image segmentation where the output also needs to be 2-D, this won't be used.\n",
    "* __Border mode__: usually refers to 'VALID' or 'SAME'. Under 'VALID' mode, only when the filter and the input fully overlap can a convolution be conducted; under 'SAME' mode, the output size is the same as the input size, and when the filter and the input don't fully overlap (happens at the edge/corner of input) we pad zeroes (or other designated numbers) and then do convolution."

    "### Quick guide for Tensorboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorboard is a powerful tool provided by TensorFlow. It allows developers to check their graph and trend of parameters. This guide will give you a basic under standing on how to set up Tensorboard graph in your code, start tensorboard on your local machine/GCP instance and how to access the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "For complete instructions, check the official guide on Tensorflow web site [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to start tensorboard\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local\n",
    "\n",
    "To start your Tensorboard on your local machine, you need to specify a log directory for the service to fetch the graph. For example, in your command line, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ tensorboard --logdir=\"~/log\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, Tensorboard will start running. By default, it will be running on port 6006:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "TensorBoard 0.1.6 at http://localhost:6006 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure Tensorboard is running, you can visit http://localhost:6006 In your browser and you should be able to see the main page of Tensorboard. If the page is shown as below, it means Tensorboard is running correctly. The report is due to lack of event file, but we can just leave it there for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tensorboard_1](./ecbm4040/notebook_images/task3_2_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GCP\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the Tensorboard on GCP is the same as above. However, we're not able to check the Tensorboard UI directly through our browser. In order to visit the page through our local browser, we should link the port of our local machine to the port on GCP. It is similar to what we did previously for Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the command line on your local machine, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ gcloud compute ssh --ssh-flag=\"-L 9999:localhost:9999 -L 9998:localhost:6006\" \"ecbm4040@YOUR_INSTANCE\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " This will bind your port of your local machine to the port on GCP instance. In this case, your local port 9999 is binded with 9999 on GCP, while local port 9998 is binded with 6006 on GCP. You can change whatever port you like as long as it does not confilct with your local services.\n",
    "\n",
    "After connecting to GCP using the command, you will be able to see the result page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Export Tensorboard events into log directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate data files for Tensorboard, we should use class `tf.summary.FileWriter`. This class will save your network graph sturcuture and all the variable summary. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in `cnn_sample.py `, the file writer will save the graph and the summary into a directory based on the current timestamp. Here is the code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cur_model_name = 'lenet_{}'.format(int(time.time()))\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# set up summary writer for tensorboard\n",
    "merge = tf.summary.merge_all()\t# merge all the summary for variables for execution\n",
    "writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(\"log/{}\".format(cur_model_name), sess.graph)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will save all the parameter summary and marked with iteration_total. These data will be displayed in the Tensorboard latter on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ... previous code ...\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "\t\t\t\tif iter_total % 100 == 0:\n",
    "                    # do validation\n",
    "                    valid_eve, merge_result = sess.run([eve, merge], feed_dict={xs: X_val, ys: y_val})\n",
    "                    valid_acc = 100 - valid_eve * 100 / y_val.shape[0]\n",
    "                    if verbose:\n",
    "                        print('{}/{} loss: {} validation accuracy : {}%'.format(\n",
    "                            batch_size * (itr + 1),\n",
    "                            X_train.shape[0],\n",
    "                            cur_loss,\n",
    "                            valid_acc))\n",
    "\n",
    "                    # save the merge result summary\n",
    "                    writer.add_summary(merge_result, iter_total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check the graph and summary in Tensorboard\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the program once, you should able to see the graph displayed in the tensorboard. You can zoom in or zoom out or click into the layer block to check all the variables and tensor operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tensorboard_2](./ecbm4040/notebook_images/task3_2_2.png)\n",
